# SimonSaysBusinessCard

This is more or less a simplification of the sparkfun simon says program written for the arduino uno. I added a capacitive touch library. 
See the circuit board project here: https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/john-evans-16/Down-East-Audio-Simon-Says-Business-Card

Will add video once the boards and parts come in.
